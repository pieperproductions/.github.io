Hello!

First, thank you for taking interest in my project here. This work-in-progress project is a culmination of university grade Python coding knowledge combined with the power of Artificial Intelligence.

Nonetheless, I hope you join me in the journey!

Steps:

(Optional) Create a new folder on your desktop titled Pridwen.

Download all files available currently on the Pridwen repository.
(Optional) Move files from Downloads folder to your newly created folder located on your desktop

Ensure all files are stored in the same directory via dragging, copy-paste, or cut-paste methods

 {Directory Examples Below}

  [ C:/User/YOUR_NAME/Desktop/Pridwen/Pridwen.html ]

  [ C:/User/YOUR_NAME/Desktop/Pridwen/Logo_white.png ]

  [ C:/User/YOUR_NAME/Desktop/Pridwen/Pieper_resume_2024 ]
Double Left Click / Launch the Pridwen.html file located in your directory

Alternatively you can download the most recent release (as of Feb. 27th, 2024, Pridwen 1.0 Release)

Make sure to extract Source Code.zip to the directory of your choice, and then follow the steps in the README file provided.

Enjoy!

If you would like to support the project, please reach out to pridwenllc@gmail.com for more information.

Again thank you for taking interest in my project, and I hope you enjoy!
